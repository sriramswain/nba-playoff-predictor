# NBA Playoff Predictor 🏀

This project aims to model and predict the outcome of each NBA playoff series during the 2025 postseason, including forecasting the overall champion. Rather than using a generic statistical approach, this model prioritizes specific metrics that I personally believe are most impactful in playoff basketball.

### 📊 Core Features Considered:
- 3-point volume & percentage
- Offensive & defensive rating
- Net rating
- Pace
- Turnover percentage
- Free throw rate
- Rebounding rate
- Home vs away performance
- Best 5-man lineups (and their advanced stats)
- Top 3 bench players
- Current injury status

### 🧠 Goals:
- Predict the winner of each playoff series
- Simulate the full playoff bracket
- Build an interpretable, deployable model
- Visualize predictions and stats in a full-stack web app

More details on data sources, methodology, and deployment will be added as the project progresses.
